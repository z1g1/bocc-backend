## As a...
New developer or admin, I want **comprehensive documentation** covering the project architecture, API usage, deployment, and debugging, so that I can onboard quickly and operate the system confidently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `README.md` covers: features, architecture, environment variables, API endpoints, testing, debugging
- [x] `docs/EPIC_2_CIRCLE_INTEGRATION.md` documents Circle.so setup and all known error codes
- [x] `docs/EPIC_3_ENGAGEMENT_REWARDS.md` documents custom field setup, workflow examples, limitations
- [x] `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` provides an end-to-end project summary with metrics
- [x] `CIRCLE_PERMISSIONS.md` documents token permissions setup
- [x] `docs/epics/`, `docs/stories/`, `docs/tasks/` contain durable planning records (this directory)
- [x] All documentation reflects the actual implemented state, not aspirational plans
