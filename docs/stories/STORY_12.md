**ID**: STORY-12
**Epic**: Cross-cutting (Phase 0: Project Setup)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Story Points**: 1
**Tasks**: TASK-03

## As a...
Developer (or AI assistant), I want a **CLAUDE.md file** that documents the project architecture, conventions, and workflows, so that future work on this codebase follows established patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `CLAUDE.md` documents the core workflow (check-in form → Airtable → Circle.so → response)
- [x] Architecture section covers: Netlify Functions, Airtable tables, Circle.so, CommonJS modules
- [x] Environment variables are listed with security notes
- [x] Code patterns are documented: Airtable operations, CORS handling, error handling
- [x] Common tasks are described: adding fields, debugging production issues
- [x] Updated after each epic to reflect new integrations (Circle.so, counter)
