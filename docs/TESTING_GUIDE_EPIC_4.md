## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Warning (Warning 1)

**Objective**: Verify first warning creation for member without profile photo

**Setup:**

2. Verify Test Glick is in "No Profile Photo" segment (238273)
3. Verify **NO existing record** in Airtable "No Photo Warnings" table for zglicka@gmail.com

**Execute:**
```bash
# Trigger enforcement function (dry run first)
curl "https://bocc-backend.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/profile-photo-enforcement-manual?dryRun=true"

# If dry run looks good, run for real
curl "https://bocc-backend.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/profile-photo-enforcement-manual"
```

4. Review function logs for admin notification success
5. Verify summary shows: finalWarnings: 1

---

### Phase 4: Deactivation (Warning 5)

**Objective**: Verify account deactivation after 5th check without photo

**Setup:**

## Manual Testing Commands

### Dry Run (Safe Testing)
```bash
# Test without making any changes (use manual endpoint for testing)
curl "https://bocc-backend.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/profile-photo-enforcement-manual?dryRun=true"
```

### Production Run
```bash
# Execute enforcement for real (use manual endpoint)
curl "https://bocc-backend.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/profile-photo-enforcement-manual"
```

**Note:** The scheduled function (`profile-photo-enforcement`) cannot be called via HTTP in production - it only runs on the Monday 9 AM EST schedule. Use the `-manual` version for on-demand testing and execution.

### Check Logs
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Navigate to Functions → profile-photo-enforcement
3. View recent invocations
4. Check logs for detailed execution trace

### Verify Airtable
1. Open Airtable "No Photo Warnings" table
2. Filter by Email = "zglicka@gmail.com"
3. Check fields: Number of Warnings, Status, Last Warning Date

### Verify Circle DMs
1. Log into Test Glick account: zglicka@gmail.com
2. Check DMs from 716.social Bot
3. Verify message content matches expected template

### Verify Admin Notifications
1. Log into admin account: circle@zackglick.com
2. Check DMs from 716.social Bot
3. Verify final warning and deactivation alerts received

---

## Rollback Procedures

### If Testing Goes Wrong

**Reset Test Glick Account:**
1. Manually re-invite to Circle if deactivated
2. Add profile photo to stop enforcement
3. Delete Airtable warning record
4. Wait for next enforcement run or trigger manually

**Clear Airtable Records:**
```bash
# Manually delete test records from Airtable UI
# Or use Airtable API to bulk delete if needed
```

**Disable Scheduled Function:**
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Functions → profile-photo-enforcement
3. Temporarily disable scheduled trigger
4. Re-enable after testing complete

---

## Success Criteria

All phases must pass for system to be considered production-ready:

✅ **Phase 1**: First warning created and sent
✅ **Phase 2**: Warnings 2-3 escalate correctly
✅ **Phase 3**: Final warning (4th) triggers admin alert
✅ **Phase 4**: Deactivation (5th) works + admin notified
✅ **Phase 5**: Photo added sends thank you + deletes record

**Additional Requirements:**
- All DMs delivered successfully
- All admin notifications received
- All Airtable records accurate
- No unexpected errors in logs
- Summary reports accurate

---

   - Merge `dev` branch to `staging`
   - Test on staging environment
   - Merge `staging` to `main` for production
   - Monitor first scheduled run

3. **Monitor First Week**:
   - Review logs after first automated Monday run
   - Verify all members processed correctly
   - Check admin notifications working
   - Confirm no unexpected errors
